I'm a PhD student in the [QURIOSITY group](https://quriosity.telecom-paris.fr/), supervised by Romain All√©aume and Peter Brown. My research focuses on computational assumptions in Quantum Cryptography, especially pseudorandom states, but you may find me working on Quantum information stuff from time to time.

I'm particularly interested in Quantum Computing (hopefully you got that part) and Machine Learning.

I previously worked as an audit consultant at [Wavestone](https://wavestone.com).
